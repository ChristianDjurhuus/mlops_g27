## Project checklist

Please note that all the lists are *exhaustive* meaning that I do not expect you to have completed very
point on the checklist for the exam.

### Week 1

- [x] Create a git repository
- [x] Make sure that all team members have write access to the github repository
- [ ] Create a dedicated environment for you project to keep track of your packages (using conda)
- [ ] Create the initial file structure using cookiecutter
- [ ] Fill out the `make_dataset.py` file such that it downloads whatever data you need and 
- [ ] Add a model file and a training script and get that running
- [ ] Remember to fill out the `requirements.txt` file with whatever dependencies that you are using
- [ ] Remember to comply with good coding practices (`pep8`) while doing the project
- [ ] Do a bit of code typing and remember to document essential parts of your code
- [ ] Setup version control for your data or part of your data
- [ ] Construct one or multiple docker files for your code
- [ ] Build the docker files locally and make sure they work as intended
- [ ] Write one or multiple configurations files for your experiments
- [ ] Used Hydra to load the configurations and manage your hyperparameters
- [ ] When you have something that works somewhat, remember at some point to to some profiling and see if you can optimize your code
- [ ] Use wandb to log training progress and other important metrics/artifacts in your code
- [ ] Use pytorch-lightning (if applicable) to reduce the amount of boilerplate in your code

### Week 2

- [ ] Write unit tests related to the data part of your code
- [ ] Write unit tests related to model construction
- [ ] Calculate the coverage.
- [ ] Get some continues integration running on the github repository
- [ ] (optional) Create a new project on `gcp` and invite all group members to it
- [ ] Create a data storage on `gcp` for you data
- [ ] Create a trigger workflow for automatically building your docker images
- [ ] Get your model training on `gcp`
- [ ] Play around with distributed data loading
- [ ] (optional) Play around with distributed model training
- [ ] Play around with quantization and compilation for you trained models

### Week 3

- [ ] Deployed your model locally using TorchServe
- [ ] Checked how robust your model is towards data drifting
- [ ] Deployed your model using `gcp`
- [ ] Monitored the system of your deployed model
- [ ] Monitored the performance of your deployed model

### Additional

- [ ] Revisit your initial project description. Did the project turn out as you wanted?
- [ ] Make sure all group members have a understanding about all parts of the project
- [ ] Create a presentation explaining your project
- [ ] Uploaded all your code to github
- [ ] (extra) Implemented pre-commit hooks for your project repository
- [ ] (extra) Used Optuna to run hyperparameter optimization on your model
